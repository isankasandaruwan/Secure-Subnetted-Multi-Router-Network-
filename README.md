Secure Multi-Router Subnetted Network Simulation (Cisco Packet Tracer)

# 🏢 Multi-Router Subnetted Network Simulation

This project is a simulation of a **secure enterprise network environment** designed and implemented using **Cisco Packet Tracer**. It models a real-world organization where the network is **segmented into departments and security zones**, each with controlled access, routing, and monitoring.

## 📌 Project Objectives

- Demonstrate secure, scalable Layer 3 network design
- Implement subnetting and routing between multiple VLANs/departments
- Showcase enterprise-grade network security and management features

## 🧠 Key Features

✅ **Dynamic Routing with OSPFv2**  
✅ **Secure Time Synchronization using NTP**  
✅ **Centralized Authentication via TACACS+ Server**  
✅ **Port Security to Prevent Unauthorized Access**  
✅ **Remote Device Management (Telnet/SSH)**  
✅ **ACLs for Traffic Filtering and Access Control**  
✅ **Multiple Routers and Subnet Segments (/24, /27, /30)**
